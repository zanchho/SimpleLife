# SimpleLife Project README

This project is a life simulation where users can create different types of particles and define rules for how they interact.
The simulation features a settings panel for adjusting the properties of these particles and the rules governing their behavior.

## Features

- **Particle Creation**: Users can create new types of particles with customizable names, amounts, and colors.
- **Interaction Rules**: Define interaction rules between different types of particles.
- **Dynamic Settings Panel**: Adjust particle properties and interaction rules through a dynamic settings panel.
- **Pause Functionality**: Pause the simulation to observe the current state.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

### Creating Particles

1. Click on the "Settings" button to open the settings panel.
2. Enter the details for the new particle type:
   - Name: The name of the particle type (Must be unique).
   - Amount: The number of particles of this type to create.
   - Color: The color of the particles.
3. Click "CREATE NEW TYPE" to create the particle.

### Defining Interaction Rules

In the settings panel, under the "Rules" section, you can define how different types of particles interact with each other.
Each rule specifies the behavior of a particel group to another.
The interaction level is represented on a spectrum ranging from maximum attraction (-1) through no interaction (0) to maximum repelling (1).

### Pausing the Simulation

Click the "Pause" button to pause the simulation. Clicking it again will resume the simulation.

## Future

This Project is not planned to be continued within close future. I might come back to it at some point.
